The call-out consists of newline-separated dictionary items. An item consists of a target languge phrase and a source language phrase, separated by the " @ " sequence. Multiword phrases are allowed. The words of a phrase are space-separated as usual. IMPORTANT NOTE: In the current version, for historical reasons, the target language phrases come first. Therefore the ordering is the opposite of the ordering of the command-line arguments or the results.
